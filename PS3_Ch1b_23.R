# This problem set is to check to make sure you are up and running in R, and it begins to explore the ruffed grouse data. It is based on correlated_data Ch1 ("Ch_1_10Aug18.R") sections 1.5 to 1.7.

# For the homework, EACH INDIVIDUAL SHOULD TURN IN A SEPARATE .R FILE. Start with the code from correlated_data ("Ch_1_10Aug18.R") and add to it anything you need. Identify you new code (so I can find it) by placing it between marker rows #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~. I will get your full answers to the questions by randomly asking people in class, so there is no need for you to write them down.

# 1. What questions do you have about the material in section 1.5 to 1.7? What needs more explanation? I'm serious about asking this question, because I want to improve the book. (NOTE: This requires NO NEW R CODE.)

# 2. Suppose Y1, Y2, and Y3 are independent normal random variables with variances 1, 2, and 3, respectively. You can think of (Y1 + Y3) and (Y2 + Y3) as the number of grouse observed in station 1 and station 2 of route 1: Y3 gives the random effect that is common to all stations within route 1, while Y1 and Y2 give the station-specific random effects for stations 1 and 2 within route 1. What is the covariance between (Y1 + Y3) and (Y2 + Y3)?  If you want, check your answer with a simulation.

#  Cov(Y1 + Y3, Y2 + Y3) = Cov(Y1, Y2) + Cov(Y1, Y3) + Cov(Y2, Y3) + Cov(Y3, Y3)
#Since Y1, Y2, and Y3 are independent, Cov(Y1, Y2) = Cov(Y1, Y3) = Cov(Y2, Y3) = 0.
#Also, the covariance of a random variable with itself is equal to its variance, so Cov(Y3, Y3) = Var(Y3) = 3.
#The covariance between (Y1 + Y3) and (Y2 + Y3) simplifies to:
# Cov(Y1 + Y3, Y2 + Y3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 3
#So, the covariance between (Y1 + Y3) and (Y2 + Y3) is 3? 0?

#1. Develop and compare a LM fit to the station-level data treating route as a factor to the LMM
#treating route as a random effect (subsection 1.5.5). Do they give similar conclusions? Is the
#comparison between these LM and LMM similar to the comparison between the GLM treating
#route as a factor (subsection 1.5.3) and the GLMM treating route as a random effect (subsection
#                                                                                     1.5.4)? Produce a figure like figure 1.2. Does this explain your answer in the same way figure
#1.3 explains the difference between the GLM and GLMM

# Metadata for "grouse_data.csv"

# ROUTE
# IDs for 50 roadside routes. These data are simulated to have similar characteristics as the original, real data.

# STATION
# IDs for each survey station, with up to 8 STATIONS per ROUTE.

# LAT
# X coordinate of survey station. UTM zone 15N NAD83 datum.

# LONG
# Y coordinate of survey station. UTM zone 15N NAD83 datum.

# WIND
# Wind speed (km/hour) recorded at 1.4m above ground at the end of the survey.

# TEMP
# Temperature (Â°C) recorded at 1.4m above ground at the end of the survey.

# GROUSE
# Detection/non-detection of Ruffed Grouse (1 = detected, 0 = not detected).

# read data
d <- read.csv(file="grouse_data.csv", header=T)

# STATION and ROUTE were uploaded as integers; this converts them to factors.
d$STATION <- as.factor(d$STATION)
d$ROUTE <- as.factor(d$ROUTE)

# To see the first 20 rows of data, you can use:
head(d, 20)

# Combine all values for each ROUTE.
w <- data.frame(aggregate(cbind(d$GROUSE, d$WIND, d$LAT, d$LONG), by = list(d$ROUTE), FUN = mean))

# For clarity, I've added the column names.
names(w) <- c("ROUTE","MEAN_GROUSE","MEAN_WIND","LAT","LONG")

# Finally, I want the count of the number of STATIONS per ROUTE, and the number of GROUSE.

w$STATIONS <- aggregate(array(1, c(nrow(d), 1)), by = list(d$ROUTE), FUN = sum)[,2]

# This is what the aggregated data look like:
head(w)

# Fig. 1.1
# To take a look at the data, this plots MEAN_GROUSE against LAT and LONG, using the size of the point to give the mean number of observations per route. "cex" gives the point size, and I've added 0.1 to w$MEAN_GROUSE so that routes with zero counts are still shown

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 3.  (from book) Fit a LM to the station-level data treating route as a factor. This is similar to the LMM treating route as a random effect (subsection 1.5.5). Do they give similar results about the effect of WIND on GROUSE? Is the comparison between these LM and LMM similar to the comparison between the GLM treating route as a factor (subsection 1.5.3) and the GLMM treating route as a random effect (subsection 1.5.4)? Produce a figure like figure 1.3. Does this explain your answer in the same way figure 1.3 explains the difference between the GLM and GLMM?

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 4. In section 1.4.5 there is a simulation for the GLMM model of route-level data. How could you use a model (it has to be a different model) for station-level data to test whether the P-values given by the LMM (section 1.5.5) are correct? This question is similar to Question 4 in Problem Set 2.
